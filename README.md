# Introduction #

Cipher Master is an application that takes as input a plain/ cipher text & a key, and outputs the encrypted/decrypted text.
Also, it takes both plain & Cipher text as input and displays the key used for encrypting/decrypting.

# Motivation #
  
  Last year, I participated [here](https://nsucrypto.nsu.ru/). While solving their previous year questions, detection of key or encrypting or decrypting messages was a particular type of problem that was sometimes the initial part of some big problem. To gain mastery over it, I practiced using numerous resources. At times, I resorted to using online decrypting tools, but they proved to be unsatisfactory and unsophisticated. Thus, I decided to design my own encryption and decryption toolkit. It's working flawlessly and accurately decrypting the messages..
