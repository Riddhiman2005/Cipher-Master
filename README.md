# Introduction #

Cipher Master is an online user friendly toolkit that can be used to encrypt a Plain Text or Decrypt a Cipher Text as per a particular key. Also after the new updat, users can enter the plain text and the corresponding cipher text to calculate the key used for encryption of the plain text. 
Definitely check this [YouTube Playllist](url) 
to know about the Usage.

# Motivation #
  
  Last year, I participated [here](https://nsucrypto.nsu.ru/). While solving their previous year questions, detection of key or encrypting or decrypting messages was a particular type of problem that was sometimes the initial part of some big problem. To gain mastery over it, I practiced using numerous resources. At times, I resorted to using online decrypting tools, but they proved to be unsatisfactory and unsophisticated. Thus, I decided to design my own encryption and decryption toolkit. It's working flawlessly and accurately decrypting the messages..



# Languages Used # 

-CSS: Used for styling the application and creating an appealing visual interface.
-HTML: Used for structuring the page and organizing the different elements.
-JavaScript: Used for handling the encrypting- decrypting logic 

# Usage #
